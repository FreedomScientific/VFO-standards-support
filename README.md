## Reporting issues

If you find an issue with JAWS support for ARIA, CSS, HTML, or SVG, please [file an issue](https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues?q=is%3Aopen) with the following information:
* Concise title that summarises the issue;
* Brief description of the issue;
* JAWS version;
* Name and version of the OS and browser;
* Expected result
* Actual result
* Test case that demonstrates the issue - provide linked test case codepen/JSbin etc.

Note: please do not file general support issues here. Please [contact Freedom Scientific](https://www.freedomscientific.com/About/ContactUs) to report general issues with JAWS.

## Triaging Issues

Workflow is as follows:

1. Find an unassigned issue. [Here is a good set of filters to start with](https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+-label%3Abug+-label%3Aarchive+no%3Aassignee+-label%3A%22Not+a+JAWS+bug%22+-label%3A%22Feature+Request%22+-label%3A%22JAWS+bug+filed%22)
2. Once you identify an issue to work on, make sure the author followed the guidelines provided above. If not, tag them in a comment asking for more info and tag the ticket with the "More Info Needed" label.
3. Assign the ticket to yourself and start investigating.

### Resolution

* Issue is fixed in the most recent version of JAWS: tag ticket with "Fixed in JAWS 20XX" label and close
* Issue is valid in most recent version of JAWS: document your research in a comment and assign issue to Benilda Key.
* Can't reproduce: If needed, ask more questions of the issue author. You can also reach out to Benilda Key with clarification questions. When you're confident it's the answer, tag with "Can't Reproduce" label and close.
* Issue appears to be browser specific, not JAWS related: document your research in a comment, tag ticket with appropriate browser issue label (i.e. "Chrome Bug") and close.
* After asking questions of the author you don't hear back and don't have enough to go on: after 15 days, tag issue with the "archive" label and close.
